# fdom Science Fiction

Imagine a website build system which was very fast for huge document sets. Perhaps it is a static site generator like
Sphinx with Markdown files on disk. Perhaps it is a DBMS system like Django which wants "pre-rendered" HTML.

This project writes science fiction describing how it might work, and thus helping build a stack that accomplishes it.
